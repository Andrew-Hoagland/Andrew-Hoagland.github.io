                    <h3>Social Fun Fact</h3>
                    <p>According to a 2018 Center for Immigration Studies analysis, in 2014, 63 percent of households headed by a non-citizen reported that they used at least one welfare program, compared to 35 percent of native-headed households</p>

                    <h3>Economic Fun Fact</h3>
                    <p>Limited English Proficiency (LEP) students cost taxpayers approximately $60 billion annually.</p>

                    <h4>Political Fun Fact</h4>
                    <p>There are currently an estimated 4.8 million American-born children of illegal aliens in the U.S. Because of our erroneous interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, they all received automatic birthright U.S. citizenship.</p>

                <h5>Pros of Reform</h5>
                <p>Changing how we interpret Immigration would save the United States millions as illegal immigration costs americans money through schools and hospitals so changing how we handle the situation would save the United States hundreds of millions. Below is a list of a few things that would be eliminated and save taxpayer dollars if we reformed immigration.</p>
                <p style="margin-right:40px">
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>Incarceration of illegal aliens</li>
                    <li>Welfare to children of illegal aliens</li>
                    <li>Mass immigration jams up school chipping away at budgets</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>If we changed how immigration was processed, mass immigration would decrease and improve the conditions above. It would also boost the economy, produce more jobs and add more tax revenue.</p>
                <h6>Cons of Reform</h6>
                <p>The Three main cons Americans have with reform are</p>
                <p style="margin-right:40px">
                    <ul type="disc">
                        <li>It will take away jobs from Americans</li>
                        <li>Could add expenses to the government</li>
                        <li>Could Lead to security threats</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Now most of these would not affect us, the jobs they would be taking would be lower end jobs until they could afford school, the 2nd one could be a real problem if the newly made citizens have trouble finding work and would require medical care, shelter, unemployment benefits could cost a lot. Lastly I do not believe it would result in security threats but the background checks and things of the sort would cost more money to the US government.</p>
                <h7>Other Useful Facts</h7>
                <p>It costs $725 to apply to become a citizen. It cost the US $116 billion to cover the costs of illegal immigration. Most illegal aliens do not pay any income tax at all.</p>
            <h8>Conclusion</h8>
            <p>The information above shows that while it would cost more in the beginning to allow illegal immigrants in and have classes to get their citizenship, it would be more costly to keep the current cycle where it costs billions of dollars to keep out people who could make the government money in the end by paying taxes.</p>
